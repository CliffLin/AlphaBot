# AlphaBot

A bot for PokemonGo.
This bot is totally not acted like human, used at your own risk.

There is still lots of bug, it will be fix very soon.

## Features
I think I got lost in putting more feature into the bot but miss the main core of the bot - Get exp as fast as possible.
I will delete most of the code, and implement catching pokemon in the future.

## Installation
```
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp configs/config.json.example configs/config.json
python run.py
```
